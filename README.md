# Predictive-Modeling-for-Digital-Marketing-Campaign-Performance
# In the realm of digital marketing, the success of campaigns is often determined by key performance metrics such as engagement rate or cost per mille (CPM).


# Problem Statement: You are provided with a dataset containing the historical data of various digital marketing campaigns. This dataset comprises both the performance metrics (like impressions, engagements, spends, etc.) and creative attributes (such as Headline, CTA, Hero image, Offer, etc.) of each campaign.


# work flow:

1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a thorough exploratory analysis of the dataset. Identify trends, correlations, and any interesting insights that could provide a deeper understanding of how creative attributes influence performance metrics.
2.	Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to make it suitable for building predictive models. Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables as needed.
3.	Model Building: Construct a predictive model that can estimate the performance of a new digital marketing campaign based on its creative attributes.
4.	Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your predictive model using appropriate success metrics. Ensure your model avoids common pitfalls like overfitting.
